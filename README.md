# Data Structures and Algorithms 🧮
Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository! 🚀 In this repository, you'll find my solutions to various DSA problems that I've encountered on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces. The primary goal of this repository is to enhance my problem-solving skills and share my solutions with the community.<br>

# What's Inside ❓
### Organized Structure: 
Problems are categorized based on topics such as arrays, linked lists, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, dynamic programming, and more.

### Java Implementation: 
Solutions are implemented in Java, with clear explanations and comments to make the code easy to understand for fellow developers.

### Optimizations and Best Practices: 
I strive to provide not just working solutions but also optimized and efficient code. Each problem includes explanations of the algorithmic approaches and the reasoning behind them.


# Getting Started
