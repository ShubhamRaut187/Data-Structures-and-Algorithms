# Stacks 🫙
A stack is linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. The operations on a stack are often referred to as push (to add an element) and pop (to remove the most recently added element.

## What are some basic operations on stack ❓
**Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
**Pop**: Removes the element from the top of the stack.
**Peek**: Retrieves the element from the top of the stack without removing it.
**isEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.

### Time complexity for basic stack operations (push,pop,peek,isEmpty) is O(1). 🕧
